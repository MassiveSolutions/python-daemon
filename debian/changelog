python-daemon (1.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Highlights since previous release:
    + Stop using ‘pkg_resources’ and revert to pre-1.5.3 version-string
      handling, until a better way that doesn't break everyone else's
      installation can be found.

python-daemon (1.5.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Highlights since previous release:
    * Invoke the pidfile context manager's ‘__exit__’
      method with the correct arguments (as per
      <URL:http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager>).
  * debian/source/format:
    * Declare source package format.
  * debian/control:
    * Build-Depends on all dependencies, so that ‘pkg_resources.require’
      works for all packaging actions.
    * Conform to ‘Standards-Version: 3.8.4’ (no additional changes needed).

python-daemon (1.5.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. Highlights since previous release:
    * Ensure we only prevent core dumps if ‘prevent_core’ is true.
    * Implement ‘TimeoutPIDLockFile’ to specify a timeout in advance of
      lock acquisition.
    * Distinguish different conditions on reading and parsing PID file.
    * Write the PID file using correct OS locking and permissions.
    * Close the PID file after writing.
    * Implement ‘PIDLockFile’ as subclass of ‘lockfile.LinkFileLock’.
    * Only inspect the file descriptor of streams if they have one.
  * debian/control:
    * Drop ‘Provides’ field, since a Python-versioned dependency should
      not be necessary (ref. ‘python-support’ documentation).

python-daemon (1.4.8-1) unstable; urgency=medium

    + Drop default handling of ‘SIGCLD’ signal, to avoid bad interactions
      with other Python standard library modules.
  * debian/control:
    + Set ‘Priority: optional’ to allow other common packages to depend on
      this one.
